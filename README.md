###### A react app for simulating dice rolls.

##### About
This project is a straightforward Dice Roller Webapp.  This is mostly a vehicle for me to learn &amp; get comfortable with more webdev technologies, primarily React and Sass.

The app provides a set of basic common dice (two-sided through twenty-sided), and also has support for creating custom complex rolls.
